# Product-Performance-Analysis

### Project Overview

Analyzing sales data to uncover trends, top-selling products, and areas for improvement, providing insights to inform business decisions. 
Analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.

In this project, I dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. To explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations and present my findings effectively.

This project showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

### DATA CLEANING
The cleaning process was one of the most important aspects of this project as it eliminated factors that could bring in bias or errors into our analysis.
I took the following steps to ensure the data was cleaned:
1.	I checked for duplicate rows by selecting the table, navigating to the data tab and clicking on “Remove Duplicates”. There was no duplicate in the dataset.

2.  I formatted the Order Date column to a more standard date format. I did this by selecting the date column and applying custom formatting. Also I change the date column to Month and Year only by creating a new column date and input the “TEXT(Order Date column, “MMM YYY”) thereby having the Month and Year Only for the Order Date.
